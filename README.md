# weather-information-app
The Weather Information App is a Java Swing-based application that provides real-time weather updates for a specified city. It uses the Weatherstack API to fetch current weather information and forecasts. The app includes features such as unit conversion, dynamic backgrounds based on weather conditions, and a search history with timestamps.

Allows users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature and between km/h and mph for wind speed.

Search History:

Tracks recent weather searches with timestamps.

Error Handling:

Handles invalid city inputs and API errors gracefully.

Requirements

Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later.

Internet connection to fetch weather data.

JSON parsing library (org.json).
